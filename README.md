Simple_Shell Project
This project is a collaboration between Christiana Etok and Ojonuba Jeremiah, actual students of Software Engineering at Alx School. It consists of developing and making our own UNIX command interpreter (Shell). The "Simple_shell" is a program that can be compiled and launched from the command line, where its main function is to execute commands read from the standard input. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the various shell programs like Kernel commands and builtin commands.
